# Hi, I'm Uswa! 💫

🎓 I'm a foundation computing student on my way to becoming a full-stack software developer.  
💻 Currently learning Python, Git, and GitHub.  
📌 Building mini projects like a To-do App, Calculator, and Rock-Paper-Scissors game!  
🌟 My dream is to work remotely and run my own software house someday!

Let's connect and grow together 💖
